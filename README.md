Hey there! 👋

I'm **Vivek Rao**, a full stack developer based in India.

I design and build scalable web applications with clean user experiences and strong backend systems.

If an idea comes into my mind, chances are I’ll build it, ship it, and improve it step by step.

My main tech stack includes **React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma**, along with tools like **Tailwind CSS, Docker, AWS, and Cloudflare**.

I enjoy working on real-world projects involving authentication, APIs, databases, and real-time systems with WebSockets.

Right now, I’m focused on growing as a developer by building modern products and exploring scalable system design.

Fun facts:

- I love creating full stack products from scratch  
- I enjoy backend architecture and real-time apps  
- Always learning and experimenting with new technologies  

If you’d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out.
